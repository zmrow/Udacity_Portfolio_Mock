# Udacity Portfolio Mock
This project is a responsive and personalized implementation of the mockup [here] (https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf).

This project makes use of the awesome [Bootstrap framework] (http://getbootstrap.com/).  It is also optimized for viewing on small devices such as the Galaxy S5, the Apple iPad, and larger screens.  Awesome!!

## Quick start

Simple:

- Clone the repo
- Open the index.html file in your browser.
- Win

## What's what
The repo has only a few files in it:

- `index.html`: this is the simple markup for the page
- `css/styles.css`: this is the custom and responsive css styles for the `index.html`
- `bootstrap.min.css`: this is the Bootstrap css styles
- `images/`: this folder contains all the images for the site

## TODO
- Provide a gulpfile for easy development.  I got started with this but didn't get to fully utilize it
- Reponsive image sizes
- Better custom logo
